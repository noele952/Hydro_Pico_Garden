## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on assembling the HydroPico garden using simple materials. It is meant as a general guideline, modify and adjust as neccesary. The design requires three principal things, a vessel to hold the garden(plants, fluids, etc.), a neck to put the camera in a position to take pictures of the garden, and a project box to contain the hardware.

## Materials

We assume some of the materials from the [Hardware Section](README-webapp.md) of the guide(heating element, thermistor, etc.)

- Epoxy, or similar adhesive

- 5 gallon Bucket with lid

- Project Box: any plastic box of appropriate size

- 1/4" - **1/2"** pvc tube (inner diameter) - approximately 32"

  - [3/8" to 3/16" Barb Reducing Fitting](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JTYT6TN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) x 2

## Tools

The only required tools to build the garden are a razor knife, and wire clippers. If you'd like to make the plastic work on the bucket(cutting, shaving) easier, I recommend a [butane soldering iron](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=butane+soldering+iron&crid=M1AR9DCSM4LH&sprefix=butane+soldering+iron%2Caps%2C170&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) with a shaping tool.

## Assembly

### Stage 1: The 5 Gallon Bucket

Instructions for preparing the main container for the hydroponic system.

#### Heater Installation

Stick the polyimide heating element ot the bottom of the bucket. Attach the heater wires to the side of the bucket, and make sure it's long enough to reach the project box. If your bucket is like mine, you'll need to shave some plactic from the bottom of the bucket so the heater is flush

</p>

#### Netted Pot Installation

Cut holes in the bucket lid for the 2" netted pots

<p align="center">
<img src="https://hydropi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/github/garden_top.jpg" alt="hydro pico garden lid" width="500" />
</p>

Cut another hole in the center for the tube to the waterpump

<p align="center">

</p>

#### Tubing

Assemble the tubing for the waterpump. The 10mm tube goes from the pump to a T fitting. The outlets of that T fitting attach to a barb reducing fitting. Those attach to 5mm T fittings, and finally a piece of 5mm tubing delivers the water to the netted pot

</p>

#### Waterpump

Inside the bucket we have the waterpump, the thermitor, and the airstone, which is attached to the airpump(we'll discuss shortly) with 3mm tubing

<p align="center">
<img src="https://hydropi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/github/garden_waterpump.jpg" alt="hydro pico inside bucket" width="500" />
</p>

Make sure and put some screening material on the waterpump inlet, to make sure it isn't damaged by any plant debris

</p>

#### Thermistor

The thermistor is enclosed in a length of 3mm tubing, so it can be submerged in the water and remain dry. I've sealed the bottom of the tube with epoxy

</p>

### Stage 2: The Spine

The spine attaches to the side of the bucket, it contains the wiring and supports the project box above the garden. The project box should be approximately 32" from the bottom of the bucket, so the spine has a maximum length of 32", or less depending on how you mount it. I used a pvc tube with an inner diameter of 1/4". I would suggest something more like 1/2" to fit all of the wiring. Secure to the bucket with epoxy.

</p>

Run the heater wiring up the spine, as well as the connector for the power supply

</p>

#### Airpump

Attach the airpump at the base of the bucket, attach a length of 3mm tubing to the airpump outlet that reaches the bottom of the bucket, and attach the air stone.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://hydropi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/github/garden_airpump.jpg" alt="hydro pico airpump" width="400" />
</p>

Run the airpump wiring up the spine, along with the wiring from the other components in the bucket(waterpump, thermistor)

<p align="center">
<img src="https://hydropi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/github/garden_tube_wiring.jpg" alt="hydro pico wiring diagram - power supply" width="500" />
</p>

Attach your project box firmly to the top of the spine, and attach the component wiring

</p>

### Stage 3: The Project Box

For the poroject box, you can use whatever you ahve availble that will fit the components inside. Besides fitting the componnents, you need to make sure your camera is placed over the center of the garden

<p align="center">
<img src="https://hydropi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/github/garden_pcb.jpg" alt="hydro pico garden" width="500" />
</p>

Mount the oled scren, the rotary encoder, and the red led to the top of the project box. Make sure and mount them firmly, the rotray encoder in particular.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://hydropi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/github/garden_project_box.jpg" alt="hydro pico PCB" width="500" />
</p>

A hole needs to be cut in the bottom to mount the camera. Mount the bme280 environmental sensor on the bottom of the box so that your readings aren't affected by the heat of the compnonents

## Maintenance Tips

There are a few things you want to do you want to maintain the garden. First you want to keep it topped up with water(nutritive fluid). The next thing we are going to add to the garden is an automated senor to monitor the fluid level, but for now you need to watch that your self. You'll also want to repalce the airstone after every few months, as ell as make sure the screen for the waterpump is clean.
